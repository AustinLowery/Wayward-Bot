<b>Using The Bot</b>
<br></br>
Use `$help <command name>` to get an example of how commands are used.
To get started, run `$create` to create a character. Once you fill out the information, run `$usercreate` to fill out info on yourself. Once you have that set up, bump up your character with `$bump <character>` whenever you can to ensure new people see your character at the top of the list! Please make sure the information is up to date before bumping. Use `$update` for updating characters, and `$userupdate` for updating yourself.<br></br>
